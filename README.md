# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
Creating an interactive map with Tectonic Plate Data and Earthquate Data with different views. Using HTML, JavaScript in VS Code and Leaflet Library, colorful and informative maps were created that include layers that can be added and removed from the maps for simplified viewing. The resulting map offers the user an interactive visual to help determine location of most earthquakes, major earthquakes, and the location of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates.
